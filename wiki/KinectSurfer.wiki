The meat is in kinect.js called from Surfer.html

A Windows PC with the Microsoft Kinect SDK installed and a Kinect attached, runs the KinectServer.exe located in the KinectServer folder. This generates the WebSocket stream for the client app to use.

Surfer.html receives the websocket stream for controlling the Earth camera. Surfer takes a couple of URL arguments to set the starting mode and screen rotation. (yet to be documented).

tablet.html is for our control tablet.

/console/console.html is an app run on a Linux host providing feedback to the surfer. Includes - groundspeed & altitude; a real-time 2d representation of the users skeleton as seen by the Kinect; google map showing location & heading of the surfer; bandwidth charts for the Internet and internal LAN data usage (confirms benefit of caching!); dump of the websocket stream.

Supporting /images/ and DAE /models/ are in the appropriate folders.
