== Introduction ==

Multi-machine view synchronisation attempt for a WebGL app.

These variables are sent from the master to the slave views..

  # tankYaw (degrees) - rotation of tank
  # tankPos (x,y,z) - position of tank in the world
  # eyePos (x,y,z) - position of camera in the world

For the master view the camera always !LooksAt !TankPos, the slave views are supposed to calculate offset views (doesn't quite work :)

*The viewsync bit is working, but the matrix math to align/offset the views isn't quite right. Please HELP!*

== How to Build ==

  # Grab the original "tron-tank" source from http://scenejs.org/dist/curr/extr/examples/tron-tank/index.html !SceneJS examples site]. Place this on a local webserver. Test that the trontank works as is.
  # Download the Perl libraries needed for "relay-websocket.pl" from [http://showmetheco.de/articles/2010/11/timtow-to-build-a-websocket-server-in-perl WebSocket in Perl]. Namely !ReAnimator and !EventReactor.
  # Run the some of the example !WebSocket Perl services. eg. "chat" to confirm !WebSocket will work with your browser.
  # Download tronlg.html, tron-tank-lg.js and relay-websocket.pl from this source repo [http://code.google.com/p/wonderama/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Ftron-tank /trunk/tron-tank/]
  # Place tronlg.html and tron-tank-lg.js in the examples/tron-tank folder for the scenejs tron tank (above).
  # Place relay-websocket.pl in the examples/ folder for vti's !ReAnimator Perl lib (above).
  # Modify tron-tank-lg.js replacing the !WebSocket server IP address with the IP of the machine running the Perl !Websocket relay'er.

== How to run it ==

  # *./relay_websocket.pl*
  # From webgl browser access */tronlg.html?master* (center)
  # */tronlg.html?rot=-1* (right)
  # */tronlg.html?rot=1* (left)
  # Use mouse in the Master instance to control the tank and camera position

== What needs fixing == 

  # slave viewpoints are yonku, trying pitching up towards 90 degrees
  # better way to resize/fullscreen canvas?
  # pitch doesn't seem to go all the way to the ground anymore?
  # might be nice to add a camera control in addition to the "swing to front" one.
  # huge code cleanup!
