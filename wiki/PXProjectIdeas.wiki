#summary PX Student Project Ideas

=Wonderama Professional Experience Project Opportunities=

The Wonderama is available for Professional Experience Students (Unit 300579) to undertake interesting projects with for the Spring 2011 Semester.

==General Background==

The Wonderama is a virtual reality display system based on the [http://code.google.com/p/liquid-galaxy/ Google Liquid Galaxy]. The system comprises a cluster of networked PC's and screens arranged in a curve. Applications running on the PC's use a variety of techniques to give the sensation of a single panoramic immersive view. The rig is installed with both Windows and a Linux environment. The 'killer app' is Google Earth running as an immersive panorama.

==Suggested Project Ideas==

Suggested project ideas for PX students listed below. Also see [http://code.google.com/p/liquid-galaxy/wiki/IdeasPage Liquid Galaxy Ideas Page] for other possibilities.

===1. Google Earth Plugin based version of Wonderama===

Currently the full Google Earth Client is used to generate a multi-screen Google Earth panorama. This project will investigate the feasibility of using the Google Earth Browser Plugin to simplify the setup of an immersive Google Earth experience.

  * Be comfortable with HTML and !JavaScript/CSS, web server scripting (CGI/PHP).
  * Solutions to investigate include
    * using !ViewSync to connect instances
    * !JavaScript/!WebSocket to connect instances
    * Multiple instances of the plugin on one machine


===2. Application to convert Google Earth Tours to run on Liquid Galaxy===

There a are a large source of Google Earth Tours available, these are a great resource to use on the immersive visualisation rigs. These tours do run on the Wonderama but they are designed for single screen version of Google Earth. We need a method to 'upconvert' these tours so they can take advantage of the multi-screen Wonderama system.

    * pull apart and understand the Google Earth tour format, uses plain text KML.
    * use an XML parser or programming language to read the KML Tours
    * generate specific extensions for panoramic rigs
    * export the modified tour in a form that can then be run on multiple machines
    * investigate tour timing across multiple instances

===3. Configuration Builder Setup Wizard for Windows?===

    * Single click installer
    * Downloads Google Earth app (if needed)
    * Asks for network configuration information
    * Asks for monitor configuration
    * Sets up default layers and settings
    * Create icon on desktop
    * ..etc..


===4. !ViewSync maths/matrix stuff, also !ReadEvent===

    * Matrix or 3D maths skills or willingness to learn.

  * !ViewSync Master/Slave switching, !ViewSync record/play/pause, !ViewSync radio stations, !ViewSync "walking" & "rocking boat" mode.



== Particulars about Wonderama projects at UWS==

  * The rig is physically located at Kingswood campus in room Y230, this lab is avialable only to PX students and is available 7am-9pm (or later) and on weekends. However most of these projects can be easily setup with 1 or 2 PC's (laptops).
  * Weekly status updates via a project wiki and/or meeting with client (Andrew). The meetings can be face-to-face or video conference.
  * I do not want printed documentation, your code along with wiki-based documentation is all that I require. However your supervising academic may require additional documentation.
  * A rough project plan at the end of Week 3. Showing how you expect to use the 14 weeks.
    * describe any technical resources that you require to complete the project.
    * describe what you hope to achieve
    * any issues you can currently foresee
    * identify gaps that you need to work on
