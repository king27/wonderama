A Windows PC with the Microsoft Kinect SDK installed and a Kinect for windows, uses a server to send skeleton joint data via a Web Socket stream to a Java Script web application.
The web application receives the Web Socket stream and uses the data to control the Earth camera. Surfer takes a couple of URL arguments to set the starting mode and screen rotation.

*console.html* is a web app that provides feedback to the surfer. 
Includes - groundspeed & altitude; a real-time 2d representation of the users skeleton as seen by the Kinect; google map showing location & heading of the surfer; bandwidth charts for the Internet and internal LAN data usage (confirms benefit of caching!); and a dump of the websocket stream.

tablet.html is for our control tablet.
