== Particulars about Wonderama projects at UWS==

  * The rig is physically located at Kingswood campus in room Y230, this lab is avialable only to PX students and is available 7am-9pm (or later) and on weekends. However most of these projects can be easily setup with 1 or 2 PC's (laptops).
  * Weekly status updates via a project wiki and/or meeting with client (Andrew). The meetings can be face-to-face or video conference.
  * I do not want printed documentation, your code along with wiki-based documentation is all that I require. However your supervising academic may require additional documentation.
  * A rough project plan at the end of Week 3. Showing how you expect to use the 14 weeks.
    * describe any technical resources that you require to complete the project.
    * describe what you hope to achieve
    * any issues you can currently foresee
    * identify gaps that you need to work on
