== How Projects will basically run ==

  * the rig is physically at Kingswood (Y230), however most of these projects can be worked on with 1 or 2 PC's (laptops).
  * weekly status updates via project wiki page and/or meeting with client (Andrew).
  * I do not want printed documentation, your code along with wiki-based documentation is all that is expected. Your supervising academic may require additional forms of documentation.
  * A rough project plan at the end of Week 3. Showing how you expect to use the 14 weeks.
    * What physical technical resources do you require to complete the project.
    * Any issues
