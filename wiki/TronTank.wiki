== Introduction ==

Firstly a huge *thankyou* to [http://www.retaggr.com/page/LindsayStanleyKay Lindsay Kay] and [http://www.scenejs.org/ SceneJS] for the Tron Tank demo, and [http://www.greggman.com/ Gregg Tavares] and Rehno for helping to get the view offset maths working!

This is a hack to see if !WebSocket/WebGL is viable for achieving view synchronisation on immersive multi-machine visualisation rigs. The test rig is a curved tile-wall based on [http://code.google.com/p/liquid-galaxy/ Google's Liquid Galaxy].

{{{
Master View ---websocket--> WebSocket Relay ---websocket--> Slave Views
}}}

These variables are sent from the Master to the Slave instances -

  * tankYaw (degrees) - rotation of tank wrt to grid plane
  * tankPos (x,y,z) - position of tank in the world
  * eyePos (x,y,z) - position of camera in the world

The middle machine is the _Master_ view, from which we control the tank. View changes are synchronised with the _Slave_ views looking slightly to the left and right.

The camera on the _Master_ always !LooksAt tankPos (the is what the original demo does).

The _Slaves_ are arranged in a semi-circle, the slave views should be slightly to the 'left' and 'right' (Y axis rotations, I think) so a new camera view must be calculated on each _Slave_.

== How to Build ==

  # Grab the original "tron-tank" source from [http://scenejs.org/dist/curr/extr/examples/tron-tank/index.html SceneJS examples site]. Place this on a local webserver. Test that the original Tron Tank app works with your browser.
  # Download the Perl libraries needed for "relay_websocket.pl" from [http://showmetheco.de/articles/2010/11/timtow-to-build-a-websocket-server-in-perl How To build a WebSocket server in Perl]. Basically get !ReAnimator installed and the demos working from [https://github.com/vti/reanimator https://github.com/vti/reanimator]. May require some support libraries like !EventReactor.
  # Run some of the example !WebSocket Perl services. eg. the 'browser chat' to confirm !WebSocket is working with your browser.
  # Download *tronlg.html*, *tron-tank-lg.js* and *relay_websocket.pl* from this source repo [http://code.google.com/p/wonderama/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Ftron-tank /trunk/tron-tank/]
  # Place *tronlg.html* and *tron-tank-lg.js* in the examples/tron-tank folder for the scenejs tron tank (from step 1).
  # Place *relay_websocket.pl* in the examples/ folder for vti's !ReAnimator Perl lib (from step 2). The relay is a basic modification of the "echo" example in that folder.
  # Modify *tron-tank-lg.js* replacing the !WebSocket server IP address with the IP of the machine running your Perl !WebSocket relay'er.
  # There are variables in *tron-tank-lg.js* to set the `fov` and `fovMulti` (bezel factor). If you've gotten this far, you'll know what to do!

== How to Run ==

  # Run the Perl service *./relay_websocket.pl*
  # From a webgl browser on the middle machine access *http://.../tronlg.html?master *
  # on the right-hand screens access *http://.../tronlg.html?rot=-1 * or -2, -3, etc.
  # on the left-hand machines use *http://.../tronlg.html?rot=1 * or 2, 3, etc.
  # Use mouse on the Master instance to control the tank and camera position.

You should run the Master (center) up first, followed by the slaves. After the initial setup you can reload any instance and things will work, since the Master view is the only one transmitting.

== What to Fix == 

  * ~~slave view offsets aren't right, trying pitching up towards 90 degrees. 3D matrix maths anyone?~~
    * ~~probably something in cameraLookAt() function~~ _Slave needed to get 'up' vector from Master for setting it's !LookAt 'up'_
  * the websocket relay needs more smarts to differentiate master and slave connections and a way to drop connections.
  * need to dynamically resize and fullscreen the canvas. CSS?
  * ~~the camera (eye) doesn't seem to go all the way down to the ground anymore. pitch code may be broken on master.~~ _eye.Y was limited to >20 reduced to 2_
  * code cleanup because of my hack job!

== Future Ideas ==

It's unlikely I'm going to be able to do any of this, so go for it!

  * only tested with Google Chrome (Canary), should try Firefox, non-dev Chrome, etc.
  * replace the Perl !WebSocket relayer with something easier to package? NodeJS?
    * How about a !WebSocket 'service' in !JavaScript on the Master instance?
  * will need to track SceneJS versions and updates to Lindsay's 'Tron Tank'.
  * grid texture is a bit so-so, replace it with better image or draw it.
  * on the slave display "Waiting for MCP link." until the first Master view packet arrives.
  * sky/box around grid field.
  * cast a shadow beneath tank?
  * home key press to return to the middle of the grid.
  * user-controled or orbiting camera in addition to the "swing to front" cam.
  * driving the tank point-of-view cam.
  * animate tracks on tank model.
  * object detection. at the moment the tank can drive through walls.
  * procedural city/block model generator.
  * ability to fire the canon (projectile + recoil) and blow stuff up!
  * need to find a !SpaceNavigator Javascript control? Perhaps [http://code.google.com/p/javascript-joystick/ javascript-joystick] will do.
  * sound fx, followed by spatial sound fx
  * other tanks and light cycles.
  * multiplayer tanks, network play, etc.
  * 2d overview map, compass, radar, headsup display, map/maze builder
  * revitalize and/or re-use code from [http://kernigh.pbworks.com/w/page/9214137/Xtank Xtank] (early 1990's) or [http://www.gltron.org/ GLtron]  _...getting carried away..._
